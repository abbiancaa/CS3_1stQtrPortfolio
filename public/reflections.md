# Anica Malang (9-Sodium) End of Quarter 1 Reflections

## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. **Arithmetic Operators** - Some examples of this are **(+), (-), (*)**, and **(/)**. The operators (just like in C++) do simple mathematical operations.

2. **Comparison Operators** - This includes **(>), (<), (==), (!=), and more**. These (as the name suggests) compares values.

3. **For Loops** - This in JavaScript is very similar to that in C++, which I somewhat already mastered. Because of that, I was able to easily understand how it works, even with its other types such as for...of and forEach() loop.

4. **While (and Do...while) Loops** - Like for loops, while and do...while loops were discussed in C++ which made it easier to adjust to JavaScript. Though we mostly used for loops for activities, it was still useful to know how to know this kind of loop.

5. **If Statements** - This is also very similar to C++. It is used very frequently, and in my opinion is the most useful thing to know how to do as it can be applied in many situations.

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.  

1. **Functions** 
* Though the main 'gist' of it is similar to that in C++, the multiple possible syntaxes are confusing to me.

2. **Arrays** 
* Even in C++, I wasn't able to fully understand arrays, and I got a bit more lost when I learned about indexing and modifying them in JavaScript.

3. **Input** 
* I sometimes struggle with input statements, especially with putting its value in a variable.

4. **Output** 
* Like my struggles with input, I get confused trying to output somethings because of the multiple ways to do so.

5. **HTML Tags** 
* The main thing I don't really understand is what should go under each tag. I get confused and sometimes switch up tags.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items. 

What I'll try to do more often is to ask questions and schedule consultations when needed. I'll also do more CodeChef practices to prepare for Long Tests and/or quizzes, especially for topics I don't really understand. 

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

### Effective:
1. **Exercise 6 (Number Series)** - For me this was effective since it allowed me to further master my skills in using for loops. It was like a form of review since I haven't used it since grade 8.

2. **Exercise 7 (Debugging)** - This exercise let me use my knowledge for almost all topics. It helped me understand the foundation concepts of JavaScript.

### Least Effective:
1. **Exercise 2 (Tip)** - This was a pretty difficult exercise for me as I hadn't fully understood the topic yet. Though I tried to do research to do the exercise, I still couldn't understand the topic.

2. **Exercise 1 (Variable Declaration)** - It wasn't "not effective" but if I had to choose, this would be one since it was very simple. It didn't really my develop skills.
